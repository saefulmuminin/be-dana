For example, the redirection URL might be <https://www.merchant.com/authorizationResult?authCode=3AB2F588D14B43238637264FCA5AAF35&authState=663A8FA9-D836-48EE-8AA1-1FF682989DC7>.

Result process logic
For different request results, different actions are to be performed. See the following list for details:

If the value of result.resultStatus is S, the authorization URL is successfully obtained by the schemeUrl, applinkUrl, or normalUrl field in the response. The merchant can redirect the user to this URL to agree to authorize for granting corresponding resource access permission.
If the value of result.resultStatus is U, the API calling status is unknown. You can call this API again to retry the process.
If the value of result.resultStatus is F, the authorization URL is failed to be obtained. Generally, this case is caused by system defects or system failure. Check the error codes and take the corresponding actions or contact Antom technical support.
